# Seasons in Finance: Semester vs. Vacation

## Introduction
This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of bank transactions spanning slightly more than a one-year time interval, with a focus on comparing spending patterns during academic semesters and vacation periods. By delving into the financial dynamics of these distinct temporal contexts, the project aims to uncover variations and provide insights into the ebb and flow of spending habits.

## Description:
Does your wallet feel the weight of textbooks more than the allure of adventure? These analyzes are more than a ledger â€“ it is a snapshot of a financial rhythm and offers insights into the ebb and flow of the financial tempo. Insights are based on my bank transactions between December 2022 and January 17, 2024.

## Motivation:
This project was fueled by a desire to comprehend and analyze my financial behaviors across diverse temporal contexts. The primary goal was to gain profound insights into spending patterns, discerning variations in financial habits during distinct semesters and vacation periods. Leveraging bank transaction data provided a comprehensive overview, allowing for a nuanced understanding of my financial dynamics throughout the specified time frames.
